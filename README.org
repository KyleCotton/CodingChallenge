 3D game of life
 4D geometry

 3D game of life where the 'cells' are tesseract (4D cubes) (rotating in the 4th dimension) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract might need to add extra complexity to the game of life may also need to perform ray tracing we could also do the game of life on the surface of a 4D object or a klien bottle or something
